# Topology Configuration File

# What TUN device was configured for the attack. This device has to be set up as
# described in the blog post, with outgoing packets routed onto the network and
# incoming packets from the server router to it.
interface: tun0

# Characteristics of the server. Remember that the attack requires the IP and
# port of the service for probing.
server:
  ip: 10.244.129.5
  port: 2441
  # A TTL value that allows packets to reach the router but not to reach the
  # server. The attack assumes the existence of such a TTL value. We find that 3
  # is the lowest value that works - +1 for routing on the attacker, and +1 for
  # the router.
  ttl-drop: 3

# Characteristics of the router. The attack assumes we know the router's
# external IP address. This can be found by either looking at the router's
# configuration if you have access to it, or with `traceroute` and `ping -R` as
# described in the paper.
router:
  ip: 10.244.129.4

# Characteristics of the attacker. The attack needs to know the IP address of
# the attacker on the local network. This can be found with `ip address`.
attacker:
  ip: 10.244.1.128
